# note this is yet another style, excatly like above

# then use the range operator to do 0 to 5 counts

# Find the Ruby documentation on arrays and read about them. What other operations can you do besides the push function? Try <<, which is the same as push but is an operator. fruits << x is the same as fruits.push(x).
